# MyCurrency
Android app for mobile development course.
This is my first Android app developed during Mobile Development course of my Bachelor Degree.

Application that allows you to apply an exchange rate between currencies.
The user can enter a quantity (default 1), a starting currency and one to convert to and the application calculates the result.
For example: EUR 100.00 = USD 105.89
The user can view the exchange rate in the last 7 days and can decide to save the currency pair as “preferred” for faster access.
Exchange rate information is retrieved from a public, free online API.
